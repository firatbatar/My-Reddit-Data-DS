I don't know if the speakers themselves are broken or I accidently caused a damage. I didn't see any obvious problem. What can be a possible cause? What can I do test different causes?

As they encounter and discover new things he adds supplementary logs. From his talking I thought he created this logs as he goes, so he needs a kind of downtime to make those recordings.

What I am confused about is his his first supplementary log in the first episode which is, 

>""*Captain's Log, supplementary. The frozen form of* *Lieutenant* *Torres* *has been rushed to* *sickbay. The question now is the incredible power of the* *Q* *being. Do we dare oppose it?*""

We hear this log just after Q froze an officer and just after the log it cuts to the rest of that scene (probably after and ad break) where they learn the officers conditions and question the power of the Q. Since Picard couldn't have made this log while he was facing the Q, he should have made it after they encounter. Then why did he phrase the situation in a way that like he doesn't know what happened afterwards?  
Is it just a (cheap?) trick to remind what was happening before an ad break or is there something I am missing?"

1. In first I tried 2 microSD (They're working on my PC but I sometimes they didn't). 2GB and 4GB. 2GB quickly became useless it shows No Card.  
2. I continiued with 4gb and almost always it stuck loading, but it actually worked for 5 times. In first 3 there wasn't any games in it when tried to put a game it stopped working. (In last time I didn't install game I just removed the microSD and put it back and it stopped working again.)  
3. It worked with games 2 times. First stopped working when I tried a few hours later. Last one freezed while I was playing.  
4. After the last time second microSD gone mad too. Even when it's empty it shows loading. (Before it was saying ""Menu?"")"
