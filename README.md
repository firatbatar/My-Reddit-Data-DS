# My Reddit Usage Data Analysis
## SabancÄ± University CS210 Intorduction to Data Scince Course Fall 2023-2024 Term Project

This project will be an analysis on my own Reddit usage. Data used is directly exported from reddit.com as a personal data request.  

### Goal
I will explore the data and try to make analysis on
* subreddits that I am subscribed to,
* subreddits that I am active in,
* the time of my activity,
* types of activity

### Tools
I will use Python programming language and will work on a IPython Notebook (Jupyter Notebook) file.  
I mainly plan to use libraries
* **Pandas** to structure the data
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (, and maybe **Atlas**) to visualse and visually analyse the data
